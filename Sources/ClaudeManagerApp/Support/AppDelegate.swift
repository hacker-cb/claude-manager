/// AppKit delegate wired in via `NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor`. It owns the app lifecycle
/// and Dock-icon (activation-policy) behavior that SwiftUI's `Window` scene doesn't expose
/// declaratively:
///
/// - **Stay resident in the menu bar** after the last window closes, instead of quitting
///   (`applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed` → false). The reliable quit is
///   "Quit Claude Manager" in the menu bar (⌘Q also works while a window — and thus the
///   app menu bar — is present); both call `NSApp.terminate`.
/// - **Reopen the main window** on a Dock-icon click while no window is visible, via the
///   injected `reopenMainWindow` (AppKit can't invoke SwiftUI's window actions directly).
/// - **The Dock icon follows the windows.** The app is `.regular` (Dock icon) while any
///   standard window is on screen and `.accessory` (menu-bar-only) when none is. Opening a
///   tracked scene (`windowDidAppear`) shows it immediately; closing one (`windowDidDisappear`)
///   re-checks `NSApp.windows` and hides it only when nothing standard remains — so a still-open
///   Settings window or Sparkle dialog keeps the Dock icon. A launch triggered at login starts
///   menu-bar-only and dismisses its auto-opened window; a manual launch keeps the window
///   (see `applicationDidFinishLaunching` / `shouldDismissInitialWindow`).
