# Developing Claude Manager

The core logic lives in a Swift package (`ClaudeManagerCore`) that builds and tests
headlessly — no Xcode, no window server. The SwiftUI app is a thin shell, built as
an Xcode target generated from [`project.yml`](../project.yml) by
[XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for how the pieces fit together and
[RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for signing and shipping.

## Prerequisites

- macOS 14+ with Xcode (Swift 6 toolchain).
- Developer tools installed by `make setup` via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
  `xcodegen`, `swiftformat`, `swiftlint` (see [`Brewfile`](../Brewfile)).

```bash
make setup   # installs git hooks (core.hooksPath=.githooks) + runs `brew bundle`
```

## Everyday commands

`ClaudeManager.xcodeproj` is generated and git-ignored — run `make gen` (or
`xcodegen generate`) after cloning, or just use the `make` targets below, which
regenerate it as needed.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make setup` | Install git hooks and dev tooling (`brew bundle`). |
| `make test` | Run the headless core test suite (`swift test`). |
| `make gen` | Regenerate `ClaudeManager.xcodeproj` from `project.yml`. |
| `make build-app` | Build the app (Debug — dev identity, **ad-hoc signed**) into `build/` to verify it compiles. |
| `make run` | Build (Debug — dev identity, ad-hoc signed) and launch the app. |
| `make xcode` | Generate and open the project in Xcode. |
| `make lint` | `swiftformat --lint .` and `swiftlint --strict`. |
| `make format` | Auto-format the tree with SwiftFormat. |
| `make archive` | Export a Developer ID `.app` into `dist/` (needs signing env — see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md)). |
| `make dmg` | Package `dist/Claude Manager.app` into a DMG. |
| `make clean` | Remove the generated project and build artifacts. |

Run `make` with no target (or `make help`) to list them.

## Dev builds carry a separate identity

A locally built app must never impersonate the installed release. macOS keys its
system-wide registries — LaunchServices, the Login Items database, TCC, the
`UserDefaults` domain — on the **bundle identifier**, so two copies sharing one id are
indistinguishable to the OS. When they did, the symptoms were intermittent and
confusing: the release's login item resolved onto the dev build sitting in `build/`, a
dev build won and *held* the `claude://` handler (the handler guard re-asserts on every
LaunchServices change), and a later `make clean` left the system pointing `claude://` at
a deleted bundle — silently breaking real login/SSO links.

So the two identities are split by Xcode **build configuration** (see
[`project.yml`](../project.yml) `settings.configs`):

| | Debug (`make build-app` / `make run`) | Release (`scripts/build-app.sh`, CI) |
|---|---|---|
| Bundle id | `io.github.hacker-cb.claude-manager.dev` | `io.github.hacker-cb.claude-manager` |
| Visible name | Claude Manager (Dev) | Claude Manager |
| URL scheme | `claude-cmdev` (private) | `claude` |

The private scheme is what makes the split airtight: a bundle that never declares
`claude://` cannot be registered as its handler, whatever the runtime attempts. The app
mirrors this at runtime, keyed on facts read off the bundle itself so the build-time and
runtime halves can't drift: `BundleIdentity.declaresURLScheme` gates the **deep-link
broker** (does this bundle declare `claude://`?), while `AppBuild.isDistribution` gates
**"Launch at login"** (is this a Developer ID signed + notarized release — the only build
macOS registers a login item for?). A dev build therefore never brokers deep links and never
registers a login item; both are surfaced as disabled in Settings with an explanation.

To exercise the **real** broker against `claude://`, build the shipping identity locally
with `make run CONFIG=Release` — then `make clean` when done, since that build will
contend for the system handler like the released app.

## Local builds are ad-hoc signed

Your build is signed. `project.yml` sets `CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = "-"` and `make build-app`
passes no signing flags of its own, so the bundle is sealed with an **ad-hoc** signature —
content hashes with no identity, needing no certificate, no team and no network. That is
not a nicety. macOS refuses to **execute** an unsigned `.app`: AppleSystemPolicy lets it
register with LaunchServices and bounce in the Dock, then kills it (`Security policy would
not allow process` in `log show`), which reads as "the app hangs on launch" — the same wall
the launcher bundles hit ([ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) § macOS facts baked into the
code). Putting `CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` back on an `xcodebuild` line re-creates it
exactly, so don't: there is no signing setup to skip.

**`codesign -dv` does not answer this question.** It reports the *Mach-O executable*, and
the arm64 linker ad-hoc signs every binary it emits — so it prints `Signature=adhoc` even
for a bundle carrying no seal at all. What macOS assesses is the **bundle**:

```bash
# exit 0 == sealed; this is the only reading that counts
codesign --verify --strict "build/Build/Products/Debug/Claude Manager.app"
ls "build/Build/Products/Debug/Claude Manager.app/Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeResources"
```

One behavioural gap comes with it, and it is **Debug-only**. `make run` (Debug) embeds an
injected `Claude Manager.debug.dylib`, which Hardened Runtime's library validation would
refuse to load — so Xcode prints `note: Disabling hardened runtime with ad-hoc
codesigning` and drops `ENABLE_HARDENED_RUNTIME`, and the Debug build runs **unhardened**
(`flags=0x2(adhoc)`). The ad-hoc **Release** build keeps it: `make build-app CONFIG=Release`
carries no debug dylib and comes out `flags=0x10002(adhoc,runtime)`, framework and XPC
helpers included. So the ad-hoc + team-less + Hardened-Runtime pairing is *not* untested —
CI builds it on every PR, and `make run CONFIG=Release` reproduces it locally with no
Developer ID. Don't try to hand Hardened Runtime back to the *Debug* build via
`OTHER_CODE_SIGN_FLAGS`: the debug dylib is why it is off, and forcing it on breaks the
launch it exists to speed up. The one thing neither local path exercises is a **notarized**
signature; anything that only surfaces under notarization needs a Developer ID archive
(`make archive`, signing env required).

Neither the seal nor the dev/release identity split is visible to `swift test` — both are
properties of the built product, not of any Swift source — so CI asserts them with scripts
after building each configuration:
[`scripts/assert-build-identities.sh`](../scripts/assert-build-identities.sh) and
[`scripts/assert-build-signed.sh`](../scripts/assert-build-signed.sh). That is the
difference from the launcher bundles, which the app writes itself and therefore tests
itself (`LauncherSigningTests`).

## Testing

`swift test` runs the full core suite headlessly (no window server) — process
parsing, launcher bundle building, marker round-trips, badge/`.icns` rendering
through the real `iconutil`, and the `ProfileStore` / `Doctor` orchestration against
temp directories with a mocked command runner.

Launcher bundles are **really ad-hoc signed** in `LauncherSigningTests`, which runs the
real `codesign` (no certificate and no network needed; see
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) § macOS facts) over every write path and verifies the
result through the public Security reader API. That suite is `.serialized` and the real
signer is opt-in elsewhere (`makeStoreEnv(signingForReal:)`): each signing forks a
subprocess, and a poolful of those blocking at once starves the parallel runner's worker
threads — barely visible on a dev machine, a hang on a small CI runner. Every other suite
stubs the signer, because it is asserting on something else.

Every bundle is built inside a temp install dir, never next to the real Claude.app. The
one thing that does reach outside it is `~/.Trash` — `update`/`remove` trash the old
bundle, exactly as in the app — so those suites clean up after themselves with
`Fixture.purgeTrash`.

An **opt-in live test** runs against the real Claude.app on disk — LaunchServices
lookup, version read, and the icon/badge pipeline — installing into a temp directory
and never launching Claude:

```bash
CLAUDE_MANAGER_LIVE=1 swift test --filter LiveIntegrationTests
```

> **Never touch the user's real profiles or default Claude when testing.** All other
> tests use temp install dirs, a fake "real app", and a mocked `CommandRunner`.

## Quality gate

`swift test`, `swiftformat --lint .`, and `swiftlint --strict` must all pass. The
pre-commit / pre-push hooks (installed by `make setup`) and CI enforce it. Keep
logic in the core with a test; keep views thin and declarative.
