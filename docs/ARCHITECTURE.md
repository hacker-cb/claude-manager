# Architecture

How Claude Manager is put together, and the hard-won macOS facts that shape the
design. For the rejected alternatives that led here, see [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

## Layers

```
ClaudeManagerCore (Swift package — headless, fully tested)
├─ Models      Profile, BadgeColor, BadgeStyle, LauncherMarker, ManagedProfile, Diagnostic
├─ RealClaude  locate the real app (LaunchServices + fallbacks), version, icon
├─ Launcher    LauncherBundle (build/scan/remove) + LauncherScript (bash launcher, duplicate guard)
├─ Icons       BadgeRenderer (CoreGraphics) → IcnsPacker (iconutil) → IconCache
├─ Process     ProcessProbe — pgrep/ps main-process detection (ppid==1 filter)
├─ ProfileStore  the façade: add / remove / open / stop / update / rebuild / doctor
└─ CommandRunner injected process runner (mocked in tests)

ClaudeManagerApp (SwiftUI — thin)
└─ Window (list + detail + editor + doctor) · MenuBarExtra · Settings
```

Everything the app does lives in `ClaudeManagerCore`; the SwiftUI layer is a thin
shell over `ProfileStore`. Logic goes in the core (and gets a test); views stay
declarative. The conceptual groups above map to `Sources/ClaudeManagerCore/{Models,
Services,Support}/` — e.g. `Services/ProfileStore.swift`, `Services/LauncherBundle.swift`,
`Services/LauncherScript.swift`, `Services/ProcessProbe.swift`.

## Why thin launchers

Claude Desktop (Electron) has **no single-instance lock** and honors
`--user-data-dir`. One user-data-dir == one isolated account (the cookie `sessionKey`
and `safeStorage` token blobs live inside it), so multi-account just means multiple
instances on different user-data-dirs.

The load-bearing constraint: **do not copy and re-sign Claude.app.** Ad-hoc
re-signing strips Anthropic's entitlements, which breaks notifications
(`usernotificationsd` rejects the modified bundle id) and virtualization features
(`virtualization_entitlement_missing`). A **thin launcher** — a tiny `.app` whose
executable is a bash script that `exec`s the untouched, signed Claude binary with an
isolated `--user-data-dir` — keeps Anthropic's signature and entitlements intact, so
everything keeps working and Claude self-updates transparently. Other wrapping
strategies were tested and rejected; see [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md).

## Source of truth

Each launcher's `Contents/Info.plist` carries a `ClaudeManagerLauncher` marker dict
(`name`, `label`, `color`, `profile`, `wrapperVersion`). Scanning the install
directory for that key is how launchers are discovered — there is no external
registry the app depends on. A JSON file in `~/Library/Application Support/Claude
Manager` holds GUI-only metadata (ordering, notes) and is always optional.

## macOS facts baked into the code

- **Keep `CFBundleIconName` OUT of launcher Info.plists.** When present, macOS reads
  the icon from `Assets.car` and ignores our `.icns`. We write only
  `CFBundleIconFile = Badge.icns`.
- **Set `LSArchitecturePriority = [arm64, x86_64]` in launcher Info.plists.** The
  launcher's executable is a bash *script*, not a Mach-O, so it carries no CPU slice
  for LaunchServices to read and it runs `/bin/bash` under Rosetta on Apple Silicon.
  The script's `exec` of the universal Claude binary then inherits x86_64, so the
  profile runs translated (shows as **Intel** in Activity Monitor). The priority key
  makes LaunchServices bring the interpreter up native, so the exec'd Claude is native
  too. The list is host-relative (Intel falls through to x86_64), so the same key is
  correct on both architectures. Only *newly built* bundles get it; older launchers
  are flagged stale by the wrapper-version check (below) and updated via **Rebuild** /
  **Apply to all launchers**.
- **Bump `CoreConstants.currentWrapperVersion` when the generated launcher changes.**
  Whenever the output of `LauncherScript.render` (the bash script) or
  `LauncherBundle.writeInfoPlist` (keys/values) changes, increment it. Every launcher
  stamps the version into its marker at build time, so a bundle whose stored version
  is lower reads back as *stale* (`Discovered.isStale` / `ManagedProfile.needsRebuild`),
  and the app surfaces a rebuild (per-launcher **Rebuild**, Settings **Apply to all
  launchers**, and a `Doctor` warning). This is the wrapper/launcher **format**
  version, **not** the app's `MARKETING_VERSION`. `ProfileStore.rebuild` / `rebuildAll`
  regenerate the whole bundle (script + Info.plist + icon) from the current format; a
  *running* launcher is skipped, not failed (a live bundle can't be rewritten). The
  marker reads an absent version as `1`, so pre-versioning launchers are stale.
- **Icon cache is sticky.** After writing a bundle's `.icns`, run `lsregister -f`,
  `touch`, and `killall Dock`. `killall Dock` flashes the screen, so it is gated
  (`IconCache.refresh(restartDock:)`): a brand-new bundle skips it (nothing cached for
  that path); a forced rebuild, a same-named twin in Trash, or a launcher rebuild
  restarts the Dock (the batch rebuild does it once).
- **Process detection.** Main Claude processes are `ps` lines at
  `.../Contents/MacOS/<exe>` with **ppid == 1** (launchd). The ppid filter excludes
  Electron's renderer/utility/MCP children (forked from the main). Paths may contain
  spaces (`Claude Beta.app`) — the parser handles that; the pgrep pattern is
  regex-escaped and anchored with `( |$)` so `/p` never matches `/ps`.
- **Duplicate-instance guard** lives in the launcher script. If the profile is already
  running it activates the window via System Events (one-time TCC Automation prompt)
  instead of spawning a second instance that would corrupt the profile's LevelDB. The
  guard uses `shlock` (an atomic, PID-aware lock) to close the TOCTOU window between
  the check and the `exec`, with a best-effort `pgrep` fallback if `shlock` is absent.
- **Locally-created launchers are not quarantined**, so the unsigned bash launcher
  runs without Gatekeeper prompts — no per-launcher signing needed.

## Sandboxing &amp; distribution

The app is **not sandboxed** — it writes launcher bundles next to Claude.app, runs
`lsregister` / `iconutil`, and restarts the Dock. It ships **Developer ID +
notarized**, never the App Store. Hardened Runtime is on; entitlements are minimal
(no sandbox, apple-events for activation). See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for the
signing, notarization, and auto-update pipeline.

It self-updates via Sparkle, but the updater stays **dormant in local/dev builds** —
when `MARKETING_VERSION` is the `0.0.0` placeholder (`CoreConstants.isDistributionBuild`
is false), so a developer isn't nagged to overwrite their own build with a published
release. A release injects a real version from the git tag and the updater activates.
